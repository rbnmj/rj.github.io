**Welcome to my personal website. Currently, I'm fully engaged in other projects and this page is a bit outdated. Since finishing my master's degree I'm working as a landscape ecologist focussing on communal nature conservation and landscape devolopment.** Among other things, this journey allowed me to significantly develop my GIS skills and delve deeper into applied data analysis.
<br><br><br>
After finishing my bachelor's in biology at Bielefeld University, I decided to pursue further education with a focus on ecology and modelling. At University of Potsdam, I found the perfect fit in the master's program *Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation*. For my master's thesis, I worked on the role of dispersal in metacommunities with [self-organised pattern formation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00306-0). 
<br>

While studying I worked as a student assistant at the *Theoretical Ecology* working group at FU Berlin, where I contributed to the development of an agent based model for mangrove-groundwater feedback [(pyMANGA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815224000343). Prior to that, I had the opportunity to help with *Drosophila* experiments on insect defence at FU Berlin and also worked with the IT department at Bielefeld University during my bachelor's.   
<br>

During internships at ORCHIS Umweltplanung and lower nature conservation authority Potsdam-Mittelmark, I gained hands on experience in nature conservation and environmental planning. However, this website is dedicated to showcase my skillset in (ecological) modelling and data analysis.
