After finishing my bachelors in biology at Bielefeld University, I decided to pursue a masters degree with a focus on ecology and modelling. At University Potsdam, I found the perfect fi in the masters program *Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation* and am currently working on my masters thesis at the working group for [Ecology and Ecosystem Modelling](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ibb-ecology/overview).  
For my masters thesis, I am working on food chain modelling with differential equations and focussing on coexistence and pattern-formation.  
<br>
I am currently a student assistant with the *Theoretical Ecology* working group at FU Berlin, where I am assisting with the maintenance python-based agent based models for mangrove-groundwater feedback [(pyMANGA)](https://pymanga.netlify.app/). Before that, I had the opportunity to help with drosophila experiments on insect defence at FU Berlin and also worked with the IT department at Bielefeld University.   
<br>
During internships at ORCHIS Umweltplanung and lower nature conservation authority Potsdam-Mittelmark, I gained some hands on experience in nature conservation and environmental planning.
