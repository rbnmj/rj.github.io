iPM-ODE is a simple Python applet for interactive use of population models based on differential equations. Important model parameters can be modified on the fly and updated simulation results are displayed in real time.  
The applet is still very much a work in progress but completely functional for Lotka-Volterra, Rosenzweig-Macarthur and for one example of a more extended food web.  
iPM-ODE is designed for research and education simultaneously and extension of the app with custom models is very straightforward.
