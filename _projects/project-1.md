## Dispersal-mediated coexistence in metacommunities with self-organised pattern formation

For my thesis, I worked with a tri-trophic food web model based on differential equations. The model accounts for differences in resource quality over space as a measure of fragmentation. With this environmental heterogeneity, coexistence of predators on a shared prey becomes possible through self-organised pattern formation. My research focus was to pin point the mechanisms that allow for coexistence and to investigate the role of dispersal in this process. The model is implemented in Python and I used a variety of mathematical and ecological tools to analyse the model. The methods include numerical simulations, bifurcation analysis, stability analysis, and eco-evo tools such as pairwise invasibility plots. 

I will update this section as soon as I handed in my thesis.
