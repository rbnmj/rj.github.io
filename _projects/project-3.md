During my masters program at University of Potsdam I had the opportunity to work on a variety of tasks using different programming languages. I will present some of them here.

## Individual-based models with NetLogo  

For the 3-week course **Ecological Modeling with Computer Simulations** under the supervision of mainly Prof Dr Volker Grimm and Marie-Sophie Rohw√§der I worked with two different models implemented in NetLogo. A skeleton model was provided for both models and the task was to develop a research question and extent the model accordingly. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R. Course work was done in groups of 2.

## Population and Occupancy Modelling with R  

The course **Quantitative Conservation Biogeography** supervised by Prof Dr Damaris Zurell introduced frameworks for occupancy modelling and spatial explicit population modelling using R. As a part of a group of 3 we worked on brown bear population modelling in Romania using RangeShiftR. A skeleton was provided and had to be adjusted for our case. We tried to point out current issues that limit the Eurasian brown bear abundance in Romania and how the population might change in space in the future.  
The main workload come with transferring the model to our research area and species. We created four scenarios to fit the model to the current population and to project the future occupation probabilities. The scenarios were based on different assumptions about the future land use and the connectivity of the habitat patches.
