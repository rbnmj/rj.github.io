During my masters program at University of Potsdam I had the opportunity to work on a variety of tasks using different programming languages. I will present some of them here.

## Individual-based models with NetLogo  

For the 3-week course **Ecological Modeling with Computer Simulations** under the supervision of mainly Prof Dr Volker Grimm and Marie-Sophie Rohw√§der I worked with two different models implemented in NetLogo. A skeleton model was provided for both models and the task was to develop a research question and extent the model accordingly. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R. Course work was done in groups of 2.

## Population and Occupancy Modelling with R  

The course **Quantitative Conservation Biogeography** supervised by Prof Dr Damaris Zurell introduced frameworks for occupancy modelling and spatial explicit population modelling using R. As a part of a group of 3 we worked on brown bear population modelling in Romania using RangeShiftR. A skeleton was provided and had to be adjusted for our case. The project is still work in progress and expected to be finished in the next few weeks.
